# Finance

I registered an account at [Interactive Brokers](https://ibkr.com/referral/dmytro991). 
Planning to buy some Irish stocks for long-term (10-15 years). 

Also have some stocks in [mono invest](https://www.monobank.ua/invest) - do not plan to use it as a main source of funds. 
Have not decided yet what to buy and how to use it in future so just invest small amount of money

I have an account at [non-government pension Fund "Dynasty"](https://dynasty.icu/). [Here](https://portal.acpo.com.ua/) I check my balance.

**About cryptos:**

I guess I will keep some coins for my retirement like BTC, ETH, BNB, SOL, DOT, NEAR, XTZ, LTC, DOGE.

## My rules/lifehacks:
* "Don't save what is left after spending; spend what is left after saving" - Warren Buffett.
  At least 10% of your income should be saved.
* Emotional tax - pay 10 % of total price of your purchase into a saving account.
* Give 48 hours for impulsive purchases.


## Quotes:

* Time in the market beats time of the market
* Whether we’re talking about socks or stocks, I like buying quality merchandise when it is marked down.
