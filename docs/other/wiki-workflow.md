# My workflow in writing and maintaining this wiki

The entire wiki is open source on [GitHub](https://github.com/DmytroLitvinov/knowledge). Everything is [authored with Markdown](https://github.com/DmytroLitvinov/knowledge/tree/main/docs). On every commit, [Vercel](https://vercel.com) that is hooked up to the GitHub repo runs [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io) and new version of wiki is published.

The order of items in sidebar is alphabetical.
