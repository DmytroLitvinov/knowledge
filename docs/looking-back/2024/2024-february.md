## Work

New hire of Mariia in the company which I am very happy to have because we share the same principale and vision of how to manage the people and
we understand fully that the employees are the most important part of the company and not "margin". Margin is the only a result of the good work of the employees.

So I keep reading book ["Scrum: The Art of Doing Twice the Work in Half"](https://www.amazon.com/Scrum-Doing-Twice-Work-Half/dp/038534645X) because Mariia recommended it :)
Started to hire new people to the company so I am involved in the process of hiring and interviewing (tech-interviews).
