## Work

Finished to read book ["Scrum: The Art of Doing Twice the Work in Half the Time"](https://www.amazon.com/Scrum-Doing-Twice-Work-Half/dp/038534645X)


## Other

Bought new MacBook 16" inch for work. Before I had 14" and since I am not moving a lot I decided to buy bigger one. It is more comfortable to work with it for me.
