## Seen

["Bad sisters"](https://trakt.tv/shows/bad-sisters) the whole serial.
["The Godfather: Part III"](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-godfather-part-iii/) - maybe at those time when all 3 parts
were filmed it was something new, something unique for cinema. As for me I can't say I like it or dislike.
I am neutral to film. The third part as for me the most interesting because it was thriller.

Watched film ["Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"](https://letterboxd.com/film/ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania/).

And started to watch serial ["Wayward Pines"](https://trakt.tv/shows/wayward-pines).


## Work

Improved our project-boilerplate at SoftFormance. The major changes are:
* `mailhog` for email testing
* Python/Redis/PostgreSQL/RabbitMQ upgrade to specific version with known problems
* integrate `pip-tools` for tracking Python libraries
* Had a vacation for 1 week doing nothing üòê
* Integrated DailyBot as a testing for out daily checkins
* Had a call with developers of SoftFormance where clarify our stack for future development like React as frontend 
  library and Django as a backend framework. HTMX will be used depending on project where it is needed.


## Other

Started to invest in [Ekingdom Simple JSC](https://ekingdom.tech/). Found out that if you are looking for an opportunity, 
you will definitely find it. 

Also invested in eurobonds of Ukraine. 
This is a risky investment so just get into a project with a minimum
threshold. That kind of investment for 3-4 years.
