## Seen

Watched a quite interesting detective film ["Fracture"](https://letterboxd.com/film/fracture/).
Also, ["Slumberland"](https://letterboxd.com/film/slumberland/) which was like an "Inception" but for kids.
I know I like cartoons therefore watched ["Klaus"](https://letterboxd.com/film/klaus/) from Netflix. I like the idea of 
describing who is Santa Claus is for children why he has reindeers and why our character flying.

Finished to watch ["Resident Alien"](https://trakt.tv/shows/resident-alien) 2nd season.

## Work

Did a 2-day strategic planning for SoftFormance where I work have been working for last 5 years.
Our main focuses and goals:
- Quality over Quantity (marketing area)
- Retention over Acquiring
- Motivation over Limitations

Also, I have migrated on my project where I work to [K8s](https://kubernetes.io/) instead of just 
single VPS server. It gives us complexity but also should resolve a pain for client
like scaling in the future.


## Other

Started to invest in [Ekingdom Simple JSC](https://ekingdom.tech/). Found out that if you are looking for an opportunity, 
you will definitely find it. 

Also invested in eurobonds of Ukraine. 
This is a risky investment so just get into a project with a minimum
threshold. That kind of investment for 3-4 years.
