TED talk by Daniel Kahneman "The riddle of experience vs. memory". 

## Work

Completely upgraded our management tool at SoftFormance Redmine@4.0.5 to 4.2.7. Installed the plugins to integrate
billable hours at Redmine so our employees can log hours in clients' tickets instead of 
creating Lab ticket in separate project.

Continue adding more linters for backend. As an example added `django-migrations-formatter` and `django-urlconfchecks`

Last, but not least: we have started Tech digest at SoftFormance. I am trying to do it 1-2 times a month.
