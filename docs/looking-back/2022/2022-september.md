# 2022 September

## Seen

Started to watch TV series "Resident Alien". I find it funny ðŸ˜€

## Work

Released Supplier Dashboard redesign at Gryps project on 1st of September. 
We had been working on it for 10 months with team of 7 employees.

Also, at company level we decidev to use GitHub as a main code repository platform, because starting from 2022.10.19 GitLab will start to charge for 19$/user/month because of more than 5 people in a namespace. With GitHub we will pay only 4$/month/user.
