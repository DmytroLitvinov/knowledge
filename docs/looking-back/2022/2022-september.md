# 2022 September

## Seen

## Work

Released Supplier Dashboard redesign at Gryps AG project on 1st of September. 
We had been working on it for 10 months with team of 7 employees.

Also, at company level we decided to use GitHub as a main code repository platform, 
because starting from 2022.10.19 GitLab will start to charge for 19$/user/month because of 
more than 5 people in a namespace. With GitHub we will pay only 4$/month/user.

## Other

Finally, bought IKEA table to kitchen. I had been without it for 4 months. 
What a pleasure it was to assembler IKEA table - it is like a LEGO but for adults.

Also, bought a power bank for laptop [Baseus 65W 30000mAh](https://us.baseus.com/p/baseus-amblight-digital-display-quick-charge-power-bank-30000mah-65w-26).
