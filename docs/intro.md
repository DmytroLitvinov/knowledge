# [My Knowledge Wiki ðŸŒ¿](https://wiki.dmytrolitvinov.com)

This is my personal wiki where I share everything I know about this world in form of 
an [online wiki](https://wiki.dmytrolitvinov.com) built with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io) on [GitHub](https://github.com/DmytroLitvinov/knowledge).

Inspired after reading a [personal knowledge repo of Nikita](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge).

If this is your first time visiting this wiki, 
take a look [meta](https://wiki.dmytrolitvinov.com/meta/) as it describes this wiki, its structure and goals.

## Using the wiki well

You can quickly search the contents of this wiki above or you can explore the tree view to the left.

## Other things I wrote and shared

I share my knowledge in longer form by [writing articles](https://wiki.dmytrolitvinov.com/sharing/my-articles).

I also [write code](https://wiki.dmytrolitvinov.com/sharing/my-github) which I share it all on [GitHub](https://github.com/DmytroLitvinov).

[Here](https://wiki.dmytrolitvinov.com/sharing/) you can find all the things I made and shared thus far.

## Grow your own digital garden ðŸŒ±

Such wikis are also called [digital gardens](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden). There is a [DigitalGardens community on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/DigitalGardens/) which discusses tools to maintain & create these wikis. As well as how to use them to develop [new transformative tools for thought](https://numinous.productions/ttft/).

I collected a list of [wikis I liked the most](https://wiki.dmytrolitvinov.com/other/wiki-workflow#similar-wikis-i-liked) for inspiration.

Don't be afraid to create one of your own and share what you know with the world. 
I just asked Nikita about reusing his repo for my own wiki and that's how my path started.
